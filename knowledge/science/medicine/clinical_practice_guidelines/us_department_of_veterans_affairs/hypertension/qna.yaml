        The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD)
        Evidence-Based Practice Work Group (EBPWG) was established and first
        chartered in 2004, with a mission to advise the Health Executive
        Committee (HEC) “...on the use of clinical and epidemiological evidence
        to improve the health of the population...” across the Veterans Health
        Administration (VHA) and Military Health System (MHS), by facilitating
        the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the VA and
        DoD populations.[ 1] This CPG is intended to provide healthcare
        providers with a framework by which to evaluate, treat, and manage the
        individual needs and preferences of patients with hypertension (HTN),
        thereby leading to improved clinical outcomes.

        Epidemiology and Impact in the General Population
        Blood pressure is a continuous variable that increases with advancing
        age similar to the increase in associated comorbid conditions like
        coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, peripheral vascular
        disease, and CKD.[5] This hypertensive risk is elevated in persons
        with diabetes and/or CKD. Over 66% of both men and women 65 years of
        age and over have HTN compared to <15% of men and women between 20 and
        44 years of age.[9] HTN is more common in older adults; in 2016, a
        higher percentage of men 20-44 versus >64 years old (33% versus 16%)
        were unaware they had HTN. The asymptomatic nature of HTN can lead to
        challenges with detection; therefore, routine screening is important in
        order to diagnose the condition. Also, the asymptomatic nature of HTN
        can lead to challenges with adherence to treatment. In African
        Americans, HTN develops at a younger age and may present with a higher
        prevalence of complications at the time of diagnosis, including stroke
        and end-stage kidney disease, when compared with other ethnic groups.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
            What is blood pressure?
        answer: |
            Blood pressure is a continuous variable that increases with
            advancing age.
      - question: |
            Is hypertensive risk eleveted with certain comorbidities?
        answer: |
            Hypertensive risk is elevated in persons with diabetes and/or CKD.
      - question: |
            Are certain ethnic groups more at risk?
        answer: |
            In African Americans, HTN develops at a younger age and may present
            with a higher prevalence of complications at the time of diagnosis.
  - context: |
        This updated guideline represents a significant effort toward improving
        the screening, diagnosis, and management of HTN among patients who are
        eligible to receive care in the VA and/or DoD healthcare systems.
        As with other CPGs, however, challenges remain. These include evidence
        gaps, as well as ongoing needs to develop effective strategies for
        guideline implementation and to evaluate the effect of guideline
        adherence on clinical outcomes. This guideline is intended for VA and
        DoD healthcare primary care practitioners including physicians, nurse
        practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, dietitians, pharmacists,
        social workers, and others involved in the team caring for patients
        with HTN. Additionally, this guideline is intended for those in
        community practice involved in the care of Service Members or Veterans
        with HTN.
        As elaborated in the qualifying statement on page one, this CPG is not
        intended to serve as a standard of care. Standards of care are
        determined based on all clinical data available for an individual
        patient and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology
        advance and patterns evolve. This CPG is based on information available
        through March 25, 2019 and is intended to provide a general guide to
        best practices. The guideline can assist care providers, but the use of
        a CPG must always be considered as a recommendation within the context
        of a variety of factors such as providers' clinical judgment, patient
        values and preferences, state and federal legal statutes, ethical
        guidelines, professional standards, and healthcare system policies.

        24. In African American patients with hypertension, we recommend against
        using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II
        receptor blocker as monotherapy. **(Strong against | Not Reviewed,
        Not Changed)**
        Discussion
        In addition to being recommended as primary pharmacologic therapy for
        HTN for reduction in composite cardiovascular outcomes in this CPG
        (see Recommendation 23), a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB are appropriate
        initial choices for African Americans with HTN.[ 136]
        Of the 33,357 participants in the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering
        Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack (ALLHAT) trial, 35% were African
        American.[ 137] A subgroup analysis of this patient population found
        that the ACEI (lisinopril) was less effective in lowering blood pressure
        than the thiazide-type diuretic (chlorthalidone) or the long-acting
        dihydropyridine (LA DHP) CCB (amlodipine).[136] Although there was no
        significant difference between an ACEI or thiazide-type diuretic in the
        primary outcome of combined fatal CHD or nonfatal MI, the subgroup
        analysis of African American patients found that those participants
        randomized to the ACEI versus the thiazide-type diuretic were at a 40%
        greater risk of stroke, 30% greater risk of heart failure, 19% greater
        risk of CVD, and 15% greater risk of combined CHD.[136] There was no
        difference in major CVD outcomes between the thiazide-type diuretic and
        the LA DHP CCB in the subgroup of African American patients, other than
        a higher incidence of heart failure with the CCB.[136] The ALLHAT study
        also found that African American patients randomized to the LA DHP CCB
        (amlodipine) had greater adherence to treatment and required fewer
        medications to reach the blood pressure goal than those randomly
        assigned to the ACEI (lisinopril).[138] Additionally, the Losartan
        xIntervention For Endpoint reduction (LIFE) in Hypertension study
        reported that African Americans prescribed a beta-blocker (atenolol)
        had better cardiovascular outcomes than those prescribed an ARB
        (losartan).[139]

        Recommendation
        26. We recommend against more than one of the following three drug
        classes together in the same patient: angiotensin-converting enzyme
        inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or direct renin
        inhibitors. **(Strong against | Not Reviewed, Not Changed)**
        Discussion
        Despite the potential for additional blood pressure reduction with
        combination therapy of agents that act at the renin-angiotensin system
        (ACEIs, ARBs, and direct renin inhibitors [DRIs]), data from clinical
        trials have reported an increased risk for harm (including hypotensive
        symptoms, kidney dysfunction or acute kidney injury events, or
        hyperkalemia) without long-term cardiovascular or kidney outcome benefit
        in patients treated with combination therapy with any two of these three
        classes compared to monotherapy.[ 145-147] Although these trials
        primarily studied high-risk patients (those with at least one of the
        following conditions: vascular disease, diabetes, CKD, or diabetic
        nephropathy), the majority of patients either had a diagnosis of HTN or
        were being treated with antihypertensive medications.[ 145- 147 ]
        As this is a _Not Reviewed, Not Changed_ recommendation, the Work Group
        did not systematically review evidence related to this recommendation.
        Based on the evidence reviewed during the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG update,
        the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate.
        [ 147] Two additional studies that were not part of the 2014 VA/DoD HTN
        CPG evidence review, but were included in the previous discussion,
        provide support for the lack of benefit and potential harm with
        combination therapy.[145,146] Other considerations regarding this
        recommendation include the potential harm of adverse events, which was
        significant, and lack of outcome benefit, outweighing the minimal
        potential benefit of additional blood pressure reduction. Patient values
        and preferences were considered to be similar. The Work Group decided to
        carry forward the “Strong against” recommendation against use of
        combination therapy with an ACEI, ARB, or DRI, so as to inform providers
        of the rationale against this practice.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
            Are certain combination therapies recommended against?
        answer: |
            We recommend against more than one of the following three drug
            classes together in the same patient: angiotensin-converting enzyme
            inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or direct renin
            inhibitors.
      - question: |
            Why does the CPG recommend against the following three drug
            classes together in the same patient: angiotensin-converting enzyme
            inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or direct renin
            inhibitors
        answer: |
            Data from clinical trials have reported an increased risk for harm
            (including hypotensive symptoms, kidney dysfunction or acute kidney
            injury events, or hyperkalemia) without long-term cardiovascular or
            kidney outcome benefit in patients treated with combination therapy
            with any two of these three classes compared to monotherapy.
      - question: |
            Are there additional studies that support the recommendation against
            combination therapy for HTN?
        answer: |
            Two additional studies that were not part of the 2014 VA/DoD HTN
            CPG evidence review, but were included in the previous discussion,
            provide support for the lack of benefit and potential harm with
            combination therapy.
